  <h2>Paris, France</h2>
  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1502602898657-3e91760cbb34" alt="Paris Eiffel Tower" style="width:100%;border-radius:6px;">
  <p>
    Paris felt like walking through a postcard. From quiet morning walks along the Seine to the glow of the Eiffel Tower at night, every corner had a story. Cafés, art, and slow evenings made this trip unforgettable. Every corner feels cinematic, like you've walked into a postcard. The bildings whisper history, but the  vibe stays efforlessly alive. Paris isn't just a city, it's a mood that hits you the moment you step in.

  <h2>Tokyo, Japan</h2>

  <p>
    Tokyo was a perfect mix of chaos and calm. Neon-lit streets, efficient trains, and peaceful temples coexisted beautifully. Late-night ramen and early-morning shrine visits defined this journey. Everything is fast, precise and oddly calming at the same time. One streets smells like ramen and incense, the next sounds like an arcade. Tokyo feels like the future crashing into tradition, and somehow it works perfectly.

  <h2>Goa, India</h2>
  <img src="https://s7ap1.scene7.com/is/image/incredibleindia/vagator-beach-goa-city-1-hero?qlt=82&ts=1742158909874;">
  <p>
    Goa was all about sunsets, beaches, and slowing down. Warm sand, salty air, and casual conversations with strangers made it feel free and alive. It was less about plans and more about vibes. Days blur into sunsets, music, and sand stuck to your feet. Life feels lighter here, like worries don't survive the sea breeze. You some for a trip, but goa makes you want to dissapear for a while.
